# m1saka

Some WIP payload in Rust running on M1.

# Project informations

The aim of this payload is to provide exploration capabilities while providing a simple bootloader and hypervisor layer.

For the exploration capabilities, [m1n1](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/m1n1) protocol is being used and we will try to keep compatibility with it.
